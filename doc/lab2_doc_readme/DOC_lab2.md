# Documentation for Lab 2

## Design of `node_*` class
The classes for the syntax tree nodes, following the object-oriented
implementation guideline in class.

## API
Since there are 17 node classes, we only show the common methods. For
detailed documentation, please refer to the class file.

#### `parse_*(self, t: Tokenizer)`
>
    parse the corresponding node
    :param t: tokenizer
>

#### `print_*(self, i)`
>
    print the node
    :param i: indentation
>


## Test Plan
All test cases passed; no outstanding bug found.
